<P><FONT FACE="FreeSans, sans-serif">TicketMaven is a program that
assigns auditorium and table seating. TicketMaven automates this
assignment process, which otherwise would be a slow and daunting
manual task. TicketMaven provides a Graphical User Interface for
managing all of the data related to customers, shows, theater layouts
and tickets. In addition, it automates the printing of tickets and
provides a number of reports to ensure that both the pre-show ticket
assignment and the at-show ticket purchasing will proceed fairly and
smoothly.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="FreeSans, sans-serif">Unlike systems that assign seats
on a first come first served basis, TicketMaven collects customer
requests for tickets and then assigns seats all at once based on a
lottery system. The seating assignment generated during this lottery
will take into account special needs customers that need to be
assigned special seating. Seating assignment will also take into
account the quality of the past seating assignments for each
customer. The goal of the lottery is to assign seats in a completely
fair manner.</FONT></P>
