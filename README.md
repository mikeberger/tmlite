TicketMaven Lite

This project is an open source version of a Ticketing Program called TicketMaven. The closed source version is a 13+ year old Java/Swing desktop app
that automates the ticketing process used by some private communities with their own theaters.

This version is "Lite" as it lacks the ticket printing code and most of the reports produced by the closed-source version.
At this time, only a Lite version is being open sourced in consideration of customers that own the program.

The closed source version is no longer for sale.
